Dockerfile instructions : 

FROM : AND : EXPOSE

FROM : The FROM instruction in a Dockerfile specifies the base image from which you want to build your own image. 
       It's not a standalone command that you run in the Docker CLI, but rather a directive within the Dockerfile syntax.
	
       FROM : Create a new build stage from a base image.

        Ex : FROM nginx:latest

ADD :  The ADD instruction in Docker is used within Dockerfiles to copy files and directories from the host machine into the Docker image being built.

       
       ADD : Add local or remote files and directories.
       
       Ex : ADD source.txt /app/destination.txt
	 

EXPOSE : The EXPOSE instruction in Docker is used to specify which ports should be exposed by a Docker container at runtime.

	 EXPOSE : Describe which ports your application is listening on.

	 Ex : FROM nginx:latest
	      EXPOSE 80/tcp 443/tcp
